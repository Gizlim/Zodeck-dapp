# Project Background
In recent years, the global collectible card market has experienced significant growth, attracting a diverse range of collectors seeking engaging, user-friendly ways to buy, sell, and manage their collections. At the same time, advances in blockchain and decentralized technologies have opened new possibilities for reimagining traditional models of trading and ownership.
While the collectible card market continues to grow, it faces persistent challenges that hinder trust and accessibility. Our blockchain-based dApp, ZoDeck which is a word play of Zodiac combined with the concept of a deck of cards is designed to enhance the card collection process by ensuring authenticity, transparency, and secure ownership management.

  </ul>
